# Adaptive Grey Wolf Optimization (A-GWO)
A-GWO is an enhanced variant of the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm, inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. Originally designed as a population-based optimization method, GWO struggles with limited exploration capabilities and suboptimal information exchange when applied to complex problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## Key Enhancements:
*Adaptive Information Exchange: A-GWO improves communication within the wolf population by introducing adaptive crossover operators and neighborhood search strategies, ensuring more efficient propagation of information.
*Increased Diversity: By maintaining diversity among subordinate wolves, A-GWO avoids premature convergence and enhances the search for global optima.
*Efficient Local Exploration: A-GWO expands the explored regions of the solution space, increasing the chances of finding promising solutions.

## Results:
The performance of A-GWO, tested on the TSP, shows superior efficiency compared to the standard GWO. The adaptive strategies and improved exploration mechanisms enable A-GWO to navigate the solution space more effectively, leading to better overall optimization outcomes.

This project explores the potential of A-GWO in tackling complex optimization problems with improved performance and robustness.
